# weather_accuracy
This project came out of a lunch discussion about how useless weather predictions are. My goal is to evaluate the accuracy of weather prediction. I know nothing about measuring the accuracy of predictions, but I will take this as an opportunity to learn. I have no idea about how I'm going to make this work or what form it might take.

Some brainstorming:

* I'd like to be able to compare the accuracy of various weather forcasting sites. I'm not sure what frequency I am going to do, but I could imagine using the hourly forcasts. It depends on how far out the hourly forcasts are available. Maybe I should start by just comparing daily precipitation and high low temperatures.
* It will be interesting to evaluate individual forcasting sites, but also see what the average performance is. At what point do weather forcasts become reliable?
