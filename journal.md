I'm starting my initial research in order to figure out how to actually structure the code. First I need to figure out how to measure the accuracy of predictions/forecasts:
Useful Links:

* [Accuracy Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox "Accuracy Paradox")
* ["Forecast Accuracy"](http://www.robjhyndman.com/papers/forecast-accuracy.pdf "Forecast Accuracy")

The measure of accuracy should also include the probability. For example, if a weather forecast predicts a 25% chance of rain, it should include that probability.
